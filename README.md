# 🎷 Practice Tracker (WIP)

Hi there! I'm Jeremiah, and this is *SUBWOOFER* —

*A full-stack web app for musicians to track their practice sessions, visualize progress, and stay motivated over time.*

## 🌟 Features (planned / in progress)
- ✅ User authentication & account management  
- ✅ Session logging (piece, instrument, duration, notes)  
- ✅ Dashboard with graphs & stats  
- 🛠️ Goal setting and tracking  
- 🛠️ Calendar heatmap  
- 🛠️ Practice streaks & leaderboard  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask), SQLite (development)
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 (server-rendered templates), Bootstrap + custom CSS
- **Client-side Logic:** Vanilla JS + GSAP (for animation)
- **API Architecture:** Modularized fetch logic (grouped by feature, centralized with a shared helper)

## 🧠 Why I Built This  
I'm a saxophonist who wanted a better way to track my personal growth. I built this for myself — to see how far I’ve come and where I’m going — but I hope it helps other musicians too, especially the ones who just need a little nudge to keep going.

## 🚧 Status  
**As of July 20th, 2025:** This project is actively being developed and will be deployed once core features are complete. Stay tuned.

## 📝 To Do
- [ ] Add goal editor interface  
- [ ] Finalize dashboard design  
- [ ] Add timezone-aware date visualizations  
- [ ] ...and more to come!
